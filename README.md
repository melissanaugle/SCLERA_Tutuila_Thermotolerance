# SCLERA_Tutuila_Thermotolerance

This repository includes all data and code associated with the publication: 

Naugle MS, Oliver TA, Barshis DJ, Gates RD and Logan CA (2021) Variation in Coral Thermotolerance Across a Pollution Gradient Erodes as Coral Symbionts Shift to More Heat-Tolerant Genera. Front. Mar. Sci. 8:760891. doi: 10.3389/fmars.2021.760891

The repository is organized in multiple parts:

# 1. Thermotolerance: 
Includes all CBASS acute heat stress assay measurements, as well as all predictive modeling. Here, you can find a script that reproduces all tables and Figures 2 and 3 from the publication. 

# 2. Symbionts: 
Includes raw qPCR data, clean symbiont ratio data, and additional symbiont analyses not included in the publication. 

# 3. RNAseq: 
Includes pipeline to check QC, map to reference and create counts matrix in Bash. Also includes EdgeR scripts, GO analysis using GO_MWU, and WGCNA to examine baseline and heat stress gene expression modules. Raw reads may be found on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (Bioproject accession: PRJNA762371; SRA accession: SRP339664). 

# 4. LabProtocols:
Includes protocols for DNA and RNA extractions, and RNAlater homebrew recipe. 

# 5. Field HOBO Data:
Includes raw temperature data taken in 2019 in Tutuila. Also includes script and figure of plotted data.
